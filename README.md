Steps to Import Eclipse Project:

Open Eclipse -> file -> import -> git -> Projects from Git
You will need the URL: https://github.com/ztkeane/Zach-Basketball.git

How to not break your project and send yourself into madness:

Open gitbash, go to the directory where your eclipse project is stored from previous steps (look for the git directory)

git add .

git commit -m 'whatever you want the message to be'

git pull

git push


But remember, store backups!
